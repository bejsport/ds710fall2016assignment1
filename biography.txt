Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.
1. Brian Juntunen
2. I am interested in data science because I feel that the analysis of data can tell us about many different areas of society, business and sports.  I believe that analysis of this data and using it properly can lead to better decision making.  My first interest in data science was piqued with the sabermetrics revolution in baseball.
3. My programming experience is largely self taught, I have used Coursera to learn Python, R, and SQL.  I do not use programming in my current role.
4. My statistics experience is largely based on undergraduate statistics, and the statistics course last semester through the data science program.  I use statistics regularly in my job as a Warranty Analyst for a generator company, looking at things like mean time to failure, warranty rates, and customer service satisfaction rates.
5. The only experience with R is using it in the data science statistics course.
6. I hope that programming becomes more second nature for me.
